Technical interviews seem pretty scary - at least to me.  Being put on the spot to showcase your knowledge and reply on command is pretty intimidating (and this is coming from someone with a lot of experience with the Socratic method in law school).

While overall I really enjoyed the online immersive program, the one place I feel particularly weak relates to talking about code.  I spent hours upon hours of sitting by myself, completing labs, coding challenges, projects, etc., but the thing that did not really figure into the mix (at least not regularly) was me explaining, describing and even asking questions about code.  In many cases, I can predict what an output is, or how I can get something to operate, but my ability to describe why something works the way it does, or utilize the best terminology falls flat.

While the online program really encouraged me in other areas, like promoting my ability to find answers for myself and using the web to solve problems, or making sure that I could self-motivate and manage my time, feeling vulnerable regarding speaking about code really comes into play for technical interviews.  I originally thought that I would wait to complete my mock technical interview until I felt ready, after I had spent a lengthy amount of time researching and preparing for the variety of technical interview styles and felt more comfortable with terminology and explanations.  But in the end I just went for it without the extensive prep for 2 reasons, 1) I really want to get a job and start working in code (and since I had to complete the mock technical interview to declare the start of my job search it was kind of a must), and 2) I already had some interviews scheduled, and figured I'd rather have my first exposure to the topic be in a mock format, and not have a deer-in-headlights reaction in a real interview.

All-in-all I'm glad I did.  The mock technical interview was a very helpful resource, especially for giving an idea of what a technical interview is like.  My advice to others would be, sure - do some prep; but go for it, this is a tool to give you an understanding of what they are like and what areas you can work on.  My interviewer was great and also provided a number of resources/suggestions for where I could improve and how.  Getting this feedback and resource list was way more helpful than me spending hours combing the web for tech interview help, and I was able to get a real understanding of where I was weakest and could improve.  This is what I really needed.

So my advice - go for it!  It's a tool to learn and improve yourself, take advantage of it for what it is.
