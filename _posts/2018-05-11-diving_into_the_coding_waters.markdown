I love problem solving.  That's the short, sweet version of why I decided to learn software development.  After working in a number of jobs (litigation attorney, analyst, project manager, consultant), I discovered that the part of all of those jobs that I liked best was the problem solving aspect.  Working with a problem and trying to discover the optimal solution (the most desirable, effective, efficient answer).  I even like the part where the actual problem isn't clear, where there is only a general issue, or a desire for something to function better.  Getting down into the weeds and figuring out what the problem is is also part of the fun.  

In one of my past lives, I was working on the project management side of a software development project.  In that role I enjoyed analyzing the client's work flows, compiling the client's requirements and communicating them to our dev team, and testing the resulting product for functionality.  One of the developers I worked with frequently told me I thought like a developer, and that I should consider learning to code.  Being an awesome developer and a great guy, he sent me all sorts of links to free resources for me to explore.  It sounded interesting and I have always been a fan of learning, so I started tackling some of the free tutorials and materials on the web.  

I enjoyed exploring coding, but found that when I was not able to work on it consistently (which was fairly frequently with a full-time job, and a kid, etc.) I would often have to go back and re-learn/re-fresh the same concepts.  I continued to test the waters in coding even when switching jobs and working as a consultant for an R&D department.  While I enjoyed the exposure to new things in that position, and appreciated the growth and development opportunity, I once again found that that stopped after a certain period.  I mastered the skills for the role, and did not see any opportunities to continue to develop (nor was I able to devote much time to learning coding).  I became frustrated with the stagnation and did some soul-searching (with the help and support of my husband), and finally decided to make the leap (*or dive*) and actually commit to learning software development.

One of the things that drew me to coding was the seemingly limitless opportunity for growth.  There is always something more to learn, something that can be refined, and perfected, or some new way software development can be applied to make something better.  The possibilities are infinite, and so are the new opportunities.  That's awesome!

And that is what I am signing up for :)
