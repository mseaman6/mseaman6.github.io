Tackling the project was pretty daunting.  It loomed on the horizon, and fell just after I took a 2-week break from coding, due to both personal commitments (a wedding, and a bachelor party), and professional commitments (my job, since I was traveling and celebrating for several weekdays, all my available time ended up going to the people who pay me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ). 

So when I actually turned back to coding I was pretty rusty, and felt like I had lost the momentum I had gained making my way through the materials.  Not only that, but I had actually finished right before the Tic-Tac-Toe AI partner project, so I then spent a bunch of time trying to find a partner and coordinate getting that done.  While I wanted to get all the assignments done in order, and not start on the project materials until I got to that point in the curriculum (I'm a little meticulous/persnickety that way), I was strongly encouraged by my educational coach and section lead to think about what I wanted to tackle for my project (and to submit my project form, since that takes a bit to get approved).  Having done that, I returned to the rest of the coursework (which was actually pretty helpful in getting me reacquainted with Ruby and OO).

Upon receipt of the project approval, I was ready to make my moves!  But interestingly enough, it wasn't the actual Ruby or project specs that I had any issues with.  The Learn.co platform had made it too easy to do all of the Git/Github stuff!  What a tragedy!  Instead I had to refresh myself on how to use Git and Github to accomplish all the things that Learn.co had been taking care of without any extra effort on my part.  The project set-up was what took forever and felt very low reward.  That and my terminal kept on crashing so `git clone` really became my best friend.

My actual project is pretty straightforward.  It scrapes data from the DC Public Libraries to show their event info.  This idea came to me when I saw libaries mentioned in one of the examples (though in that example they were pulling a list of books).  I remembered the days when I was at home with my little one, and trying to find out what events the local libaries had available, and whether it was an event that would be enjoyable and appropriate for our attendance.  It wasn't particularly easy to gather that info in a quick manner, and even less simple to do it when navigating from a phone.  Voila!  My project idea was born.  Really important to me in crafting my project was that regardless of whether or not my project is actually used, I wanted to make sure that it was something that responded directly to an actual need.  That it could fix something!  :D

Scraping the data took a little time. The DC Public Library pages are surprisingly involved, and it took a bunch of testing to actually get the correct selctors (while excluding the similarly labeled materials on another tab), and also ensuring that I had the correct ones to allow me to iterate through the options properly.  But once that was accomplished it seemed to all fly by.  Creating my Event class, and getting the data from my Scraper to the Events seemed pretty straightforward, as did actually building the CLI (so good job on the coursework Flatiron!).  I ran into one snafu in the process, and scheduled a 1-on-1 project support session to get help on it, only to realize the issue as I was describing it to her (whoops!), but she was very helpful nonetheless, and I got some additional info about project scope and requirements answered as well.

That about sums it all up.  Overall, much more painless than I expected (as to actual project work/Ruby coding), but the project really got me to re-commit (funny, huh?) the Git/Github basics, which I am sure will serve me well over the coming months.

Now let's move on to the next thing!
