As I started this adventure in coding I was also asked to help start a business.  It seemed a very exciting and intriguing offer, and also something that was entirely new to me.  My professional life has already had quite a bit of variety (litigation attorney, project manager, management consultant), and that only includes the jobs I had *after* all my schooling (my more complete work history includes a variety of positions in retail, real estate - both sales and escrow/title, and administative support services).

I have found a number of similarities between my two current pursuits (coding and starting a new business).  Both are mentally challenging, and at times mentally exhausting.  Both have required me to be constantly learning.  And both have required me to step out of what I already know and hunt down the information I need.  

But perhaps the most important commonality, is the lesson that I have gained from both, that it is ok to make mistakes, and that sometimes they need to happen in order to learn from them and move forward.  This education has been quite difficult for me, and an exercise that is *very* new to me despite my relatively extensive resume.  In my past jobs and professions, I have approached the roles in a consistent manner: I take time to learn something, and then perfect it, and then I feel confident in my abilities and my mastery of the skill.  Neither of my current roles afford me this convenience and closure (nor do I believe that it will truly develop upon extended tenure in these vocations).   This is the real reason both roles feel so new and challenging.  

While this does seem pretty scary to me, and truly extends my comfort zone, I hope that it also signals that this is the right direction for me.  All other positions I have held seem to cease to be challenging and interesting to me at some point in their lifecycle, and then I start reaching for something new.  If these roles never provide the closure, and convenience of ease, or reaching a point of comfort, then maybe they will continue to be exciting and interesting, and I will have found roles where I can continue to find gratification.

My other somewhat related struggle, which I include in here both for those who are experiencing similar issues, as well as those who may have overcome them themselves (*if so, let me know how you did it!*), is the new challenge of me being the guardian of my own time, and putting in hours at my discretion.  I am having to learn important lessons in time management, and trying to allow myself permission to find a way to stop working and be comfortable with what I have accomplished.  With both the coding and the new business, there is **always** more that I could do, and I do not have the hourly expectations laid out from more formal work structures to guide me (you will work 40 hours/week, or you will accomplish "X" task).  I always want to get everything accomplished, and do the best work possible, and this has made it both frustrating and challenging to find balance with this new way of life (especially in a manner where I am able to let go and not feel encumbered by what I could be doing when I step away).
