While it's hard to believe that my I'm zero-ing in on the conclusion of my Flatiron coding journey, I am seriously looking forward to the next step - working in code.  The last project did a good job of introducing us to this idea.  Not only did we utilize a great deal of the curriculum for this project, but the project requirements also had us build functionality beyond that which we were formally taught.  

I think this was helpful in getting used to the idea of making our way in the real world.  Even if I end up in roles with heaps of formalized training with a horde of experienced developers who are happy to lend their wisdom, knowing that I am capable of finding my own answers, and working in the unknown does a great deal for promoting my own belief that I am actually a developer/software-engineer.

That still seems scary to say, and I don't know that I'll wholly embrace that viewpoint until I get a job in the field, but thinking of myself as capable helps me feel like I can actually do this!  This crazy thing of entirely changing my career, especially from roles that were financially secure, stable work, that I was very qualified at doing.  

Moving into the unknown, and choosing a path where I have to get comfortable with the idea that there is SOOO much I don't know, has definitely been quite the adventure!  It's been amusing moving forward in the program month after month only to have my world opened up to the fact that there is even more I don't know then I had realized in the beginning.  

However, it has been really interesting to see what carries over from other roles, or what parts of my personal predilections/propensities carry over into code and may even be what will contribute to me being successful in this role.  In my opinion, you can only show true mastery of a subject if you are capable of breaking it down and explaining it to someone (and someone *without* an understanding of it already).  The less opaque and complicated, or conversely, the more readable and transparent, the better.  This is a belief I have subscribed to for quite some time, including during my roles as an attorney and consultant.  

Good writing, whether that be a court brief, requirements documentation, or code, should be concise, logical, and organized.  Not only will this be a boon when working with other programmers, but it is helpful for all aspects of development, whether that be working with a client to break down their needs, translating them to a solution, or generating testing and supporting documents (or working with the individuals who will be carrying this out).  My understanding of something is not half as important as my ability to convey this information to someone else.

All in all, I think I am ready to put myself out there, to think of myself more than just a student of code, and instead **be** a programmer; and I'm coming around to the idea that I am competent and qualified to do just that.
