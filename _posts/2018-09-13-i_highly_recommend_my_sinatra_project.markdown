The most difficult part of the project for me relates to choosing what to make.  The idea of spending a bunch of time making something that no one will have a use for is really frustrating to me.  So brainstorming an idea for something that could at least be used by me and my friends became my chief mission.  I had a backup idea, but after talks with my Ed Coach, realized that there were probably already plenty of adequate solutions for that particular problem (and it wasn't really a problem to me anymore... I had outgrown the utility personally).  After throwing it around with my husband and my sister, I finally decided to make an application for Recommendations.  

This determination was largely made because of a gap in the current system.  Our friend group has a Voxer message string for recommendations, so when we run into a food we love, a pair of slippers that are truly amazing, a book we should read, etc., we let everyone know about it there.  The downside is, for those of us who are too cheap to buy the paid Voxer version (this includes me personally, and about 3/4 of the other members of our group), you can't go back farther than a couple of messages.  Any of the recommendations that were made a while ago are lost to you (wait, who was that great dry cleaner again??).  Not to mention, there is not much (or any) organization to this information.  It is posted when someone thinks of something to recommend, or when someone is asking for a recommendation.  

Enter my Sinatra project.

The application I put together is still relatively bare bones, but now provides a place where we can post and view recommendations (and they don't get lost in the ether after a couple of days).  A user has to create a user account, and then can log in and see the current recommendations and create new ones.  Recommendations have a Category, and there are various ways to view the recommendation information (as a complete list, by the user that recommended them, and by category).  Overall, I think it gets the job done, but I'm looking forward to adding additional functionality in the future.

Building the project seemed fairly straightforward and systematic to me (which I like):
1) Setting up general folder structure and required files
2) Deciding on the models and relationships
3) Creating my migrations and models (the M of MVC)
4) Handling the "User" stuff (the various controller actions and views related to signing up, logging in, logging out, etc.)
5) Working on the "Recommendation" side of things (CRUD controller actions and views)
6) Cleaning it up, testing functionality, and adding some validations/checks
7) Making it pretty-ish (I almost skipped over this completely; but I'm glad I didn't)

The experience of building was enjoyable.  I would work on my project and lose track of time, especially as I was building out the functionality.  The appearance side was a little more work for me, took more time than I thought it should, and didn't come as naturally (I'd like to say that was because it had been a bit since I worked on those materials, but I think it simply relates to me not being as interested in that side of things).  Also, it was comforting that the git/GitHub stuff seemed to come back relatively quickly.  I remembered that being a hold up for the creation of my first project, so it was nice to know that I wasn't starting back at the beginning.  

I am happy with what I created (which I think is the most I can ask for from this experience), but I can't wait to build it out even more and share it with my buddies!
