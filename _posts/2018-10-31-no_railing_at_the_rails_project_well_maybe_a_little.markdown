My prior project frustrations of coming up with an idea were averted by extending upon my Recommendations app.  The main reason for this being that it is a product that my friends and I could actually use.  I would rather invest more time in extending it/refining it, then build something else that may or may not be useful to anyone.  The second reason I chose to do this is because I wanted to more consciously note where Sinatra (a more bare bones framework) diverges from Rails.  

As I progressed through Rails, I was repeatedly torn by whether or not I liked the framework.  On one hand it seemed almost magical in its ability to accomplish certain tasks (like connecting objects and forms), but on the other it seemed to be a lot less intuitive to me regarding how and why certain things interacted or didn't interact together a certain way (like route naming and some of the relationships within the forms).  I noticed that I put a lot more conscious thought into creation and spent a lot more time looking back at past lessons and labs, as well as much, much more time looking through documentation.  However, even that seems to be a double-edged sword.  It was more time consuming for sure, (this project definitely took me a great deal longer to put together than my prior Sinatra project); but I also spent a lot more time investigating resources and finding answers elsewhere, which while frustrating and annoying when trying to progress rapidly, is a skill that I know I will need to utilize much more in the future.  

All in all, I'm still split.  I like the straightforwardness of explicitly laying out what you are trying to do, and knowing what will happen as a result.  I moved very quickly through the Sinatra section and project, in large part because it just seemed to make sense, and I infrequently needed to go back to review, or find answers to things as I worked.  Yet I also feel that like much of this course, we learn how the underlying fundamentals function, so that we can progress to employing more and more complex and intricate functionality.  

With familiarity and continued application I think I will become more comfortable and confident in my use of Rails (and likely learn to value and appreciate it to a greater extent).  Additionally, I am actually looking forward to trying to set aside some time to read through the Rails Guides more comprehensively.  So far I used them as I worked, to find answers to specific questions as they came up (and sometimes read a bit beyond the particular obstacle that confronted me), but overall, I think that there is much more that this resource has to offer.  Perhaps, as my knowledge progresses so will my admiration for Rails overall.

Not going to fall off the Rails just yet...
